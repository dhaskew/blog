# Why
The killer wifi card in the laptop was unreliable and I discovered others are getting better results with an intel card.  My results are mixed and I haven't decided if it was worth it.

Install wasn't complicated, but the parts are all small and my big(ish) hands had trouble with some of the small connectors. It took me 30 mins.
