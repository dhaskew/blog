summary: Audio and Sound Card Details

Every once in a while this laptop will not detect the sound card after a reboot.  Sometimes a subsequent reboot will fix it, but sometimes not.

I"ve had to execute the following sequence:

* turn off audio in the bios (hold F12 to get to boot menu)
* boot into linux
* reboot into bios
* turn audio back on
* boot into linux
* win at life.

Hope this helps.
