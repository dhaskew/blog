I bought an [Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine](https://store.ui.com/collections/routing-switching/products/unifi-dream-machine) and its awesome.

Link to configuration : <https://192.168.1.1/home>

note: ip address of UDM - username = "root"  and password = UBIQUITI password
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.1
```
